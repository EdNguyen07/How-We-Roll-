Use Case

There are two kinds of people in this world: those who would travel in a recreational vehicle (RV) and those who wouldn’t. The RV community is increasing exponentially across the globe. Over the past few years, HowWeRoll Rentals, the world’s largest RV rental company, has increased its global footprint and camper fleet tenfold. HowWeRoll offers travelers superior RV rental and roadside assistance services. Their tagline is, “We have great service, because that’s How We Roll!” Their rental fleet includes every style of camper vehicle, from extra large, luxurious homes on wheels to bare bones, retro Winnebagos.

You have been hired as the lead Salesforce developer to automate and scale HowWeRoll’s reach. For travelers, not every journey goes according to plan. Unfortunately, there’s bound to be a bump in the road at some point along the way. Thankfully, HowWeRoll has an amazing RV repair squad who can attend to any maintenance request, no matter where you are. These repairs address a variety of technical difficulties, from a broken axle to a clogged septic tank.

As the company grows, so does HowWeRoll’s rental fleet. While it’s great for business, the current service and maintenance process is challenging to scale. In addition to service requests for broken or malfunctioning equipment, routine maintenance requests for vehicles have grown exponentially. Without routine maintenance checks, the rental fleet is susceptible to avoidable breakdowns.

That’s where you come in! HowWeRoll needs you to automate their Salesforce-based routine maintenance system. You’ll ensure that anything that might cause unnecessary damage to the vehicle, or worse, endanger the customer is flagged. You’ll also integrate Salesforce with HowWeRoll’s back-office system that keeps track of warehouse inventory. This completely separate system needs to sync on a regular basis with Salesforce. Synchronization ensures that HowWeRoll’s headquarters (HQ) knows exactly how much equipment is available when making a maintenance request, and alerts them when they need to order more equipment.
